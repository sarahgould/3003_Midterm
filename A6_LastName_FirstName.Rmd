For the midterm proposal, briefly describe your topic along with both an article/report/blog and a dataset. *Submit both `.Rmd` and "knitted"`.html` files*

# Article

- Include a link to access your article. 

https://degree.lamar.edu/articles/undergraduate/parents-education-level-and-childrens-success/

- Provide your presentation title. It can be the same as the title of your article. Or, you can modify the title.

The Effects of Socio-Economic Status on Student Performance in Exams
# Data

- Describe your dataset that is relevant, related to, and informative of the article.

- Print the first 6 rows using function `head()`.

```{r}

```


# Data Validation

- Check the content of the attributes, traits, features, rows, and/or other properties specific to your dataset.

   + Is the data type correct for this field?

   + Is the value within the valid range or part of a domain or enumerated list?

   + Check for duplicates, for example of a unique key.

   + Check for nulls. Are there mandatory values, or are null / empty values allowed? Are the null types consistent (NaN, infinity, empty strings, etc.)?


- Tips: for duplicates, use function `unique()`. For missing values, use function `is.na()`. To delete all rows with a missing, use function `na.omit()`. Feel free to use other functions to check duplicates and missing values.

```{r}

```

    
# Plot 

- Describe a plot type that you like to create (e.g., barplot, boxplot, scatterplot).

We want to make boxplots correltating sex and performance on math, reading, and writing exams. We also want to create a boxplot to associate the status of lunch (whether free or reduced) to exam scores. We could additionally make conditioning plots to see if there is any evidence of Simpson's Paradox. Additionally, we can create scatterplots comparing two types of exams, such as math and reading, to see if students who achieve well in oen subject also do well in another. 

# Post on Discussion Board

- Check your presentation day. 

- Create a post on the discussion board with your presentation title as the post title by 11:59 pm, Feb 15. You'll edit your post on the discussion board to include your presentation files.

- You should upload your presentation files (rmd & html) and dataset you used on the discussion board by the day before your presentation day. For example, if you're a presenter on Feb 21, upload your presentation files by 11:59 pm, Feb 20.
